# Nintendo 3DS Linux Loader using Memchunkhax II

## What this is

Linux Loader based on [SuperUserLib3DS](https://github.com/delebile/SuperUserLib3DS)

## Stability

The library itself should not cause any brick, but i do not own any responsability of the use anyone makes of it.

The bootrate of the exploits is right now pretty reliable, but the app fails to return to the Homebrew Launcher.

## Exploits Used
